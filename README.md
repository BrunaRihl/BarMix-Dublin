## User Experience (UX) 

### Website overview 

Barmix is a fictional team of bartenders that I created. The Barmix website is a functional platform that connects professional bartenders to clients seeking bar services for events and workshops. As it is not a physical establishment, the site highlights the services and offerings of qualified bartenders who are hired to cater to various locations in Dublin, such as parties, celebrations, fairs, corporate events, and workshops. 

### User base  

  * People seeking bartender services residents of Dublin or planning events in Dublin.

  * Workshop Coordinators: Organizers of workshops and training sessions interested in hiring bartenders to conduct practical mixology classes. 

  * Mixology Enthusiasts: Individuals who have a passion for cocktails and mixology, in search of experienced bartenders to provide services for private events or skill-enhancement workshops. 

 
### Website Goals

  * Facilitate the process of hiring professional bartenders for events, workshops, and mobile mixology through the website.

## Design

### Color palette

I was primarily inspired by the vibrant blue color of the cocktail in the hero image when choosing the color palette for the website.  

The chosen color palette combines soft tones of white, light gray, and shades of blue, creating a sense of elegance and professionalism for the website. Additionally, the use of soft colors in contrast with darker ones helped create a pleasant visual experience and facilitated reading and navigation on the website.  

![Barmix website color palette](/assets/images/colors-palette.jpg)  

### Typography 

Google Fonts was utilized to incorporate the selected font styles into the website. 

The font "Lora" was chosen for most of the text used on the website, a versatile and legible serif font, ideal for long texts. On the other hand, the font "Cinzel Decorative" was used for headings and highlights as it is a more ornate and impactful display font.  

![Barmix fonts choosen Lora and Cinzel Decorative](/assets/images/fonts.jpg)  


### Imagery 

The selected images for the website aim to showcase the professional and engaging work of bartenders at events and workshops. The chosen photographs portray cocktails being crafted, skilled mixologists in action, and images that align with the services offered on the site, all with the purpose of inspiring confidence in potential clients. 


## Features

The website consists of four pages: a welcoming home page, a detailed services page, a gallery, and a contact us page. 

### Navigation bar 

* All pages have a responsive navigation bar at the top.  
* At the top left, there is the "BarMix" logo, which, when clicked, takes the user back to the home page.  
* On the top right, there is the menu with links to the pages of the site - Home, Services, Gallery, and Contact Us.  
* To ensure that the menu items are aligned on smaller screens such as tablets and smartphones, adjustments were made in media queries to center them below the logo.  
* To facilitate the user's understanding of their location on the website, a border effect was added when the mouse cursor hovers over the menu items and when the page is open, the name of the page remains in bold.  

![Barmix nav bar](/assets/images/nav.jpg)

### Home Page 

#### Header: 

* The chosen hero image showcases a skillful bartender crafting a cocktail. The selected photo boasts excellent resolution and vibrant colors, which helps grab visitors' attention right from the start. 
* Additionally, I added an unblur and zoom out effect to create an element of surprise and curiosity and a text overlay to reinforce the main idea of the website to users.  

![Barmix header - image hero](/assets/images/hero.jpg)

#### Sections: 

* Below the hero image, users will find the sections "About Us" and "Why Choose Us." 

  * The "About Us" section highlights the team of bartenders and provides a brief overview of the services offered, with the option to click on the "Services" text for more information. It also outlines the advantages of hiring this service. 

  * The "Why Choose Us" section is showcased with a background image of bottles, featuring icons that highlight the key strengths of "Barmix" bartenders.  

![Barmix about us and why choose us section](/assets/images/about-choose.jpg)


### Services: 

* The "Services" page contains detailed information about the services offered by the group of bartenders, including private event bartending, mobile mixology, and workshops. 

* It also showcases the types of packages offered for different event types, empowering clients to make well-suited choices according to their specific requirements.

![Barmix packages - services page](/assets/images/packages.jpg)

### Gallery:

* The gallery page was created with the intention of showcasing the best photos captured at previous events.

* The curved edges of the images placed in the gallery were chosen to align with the design styles used in other areas of the website as well.

![Barmix gallery page](/assets/images/gallery.jpg)

 
### Contact us: 

* The contact page features a comprehensive contact form, requesting the user's name and email, along with details about the type of service they are seeking and the scheduled event date. 
* Additionally, there is a space for the user to leave their message, with a pre-written text providing guidance on the key information they should provide. This ensures that the user has a streamlined experience and knows exactly what is required to submit their message efficiently.  

![Barmix contact us page](/assets/images/contact.jpg)


### The footer: 

* All pages of the website have a footer at the bottom of the page. 

* The social media icons have been included, allowing users to access the community's social platforms and stay connected and updated.  

* Clicking on these icons will open the links in new tabs for ease of navigation.  

![Barmix footer](/assets/images/footer.jpg)  

### Features and resources to be added in the future  

* Add prices for services and packages to enhance clarity for users;  
* Create a page with weekly updated cocktail recipe ideas, providing users with a reason to revisit the website regularly;  
* Implement an online service booking system, streamlining the contract process with integrated scheduling and payment tools.

### Accessibility  

Right from the beginning of the project, the website's design was carefully crafted with accessibility in mind. Particular attention was paid to ensuring sufficient color contrast, clear header structure, consistent navigation throughout the site, employing semantic HTML and incorporating descriptive "alt" attributes for images on the website.

#### LightHouse  
The accessibility, performance, best practices, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) of the website were analyzed using the LightHouse tool available in Google Chrome's DevTools.

### Bugs

#### Solved Bugs

*  I started the project using Love Running as the template structure for my website, where I used float to position the content on the page. However, when developing the services section, I encountered difficulties as the contents started to overlap. As a solution, I decided to restart the code using the Flexbox layout model. I also redesigned the navigation bar and footer to maintain consistency, making it easier to build responsive pages.

* During one of my sessions with my mentor, Jubril, he noticed that the services page and the form were not adapting ideally to small mobile screens. To address this, he suggested removing elements one by one from the code using Google DevTools to pinpoint the issue. Upon identifying the problem, I adjusted the margins, padding, and max-width within the media queries, successfully resolving the issue.

#### Unsolved Bugs

No unfixed bugs on the website.
