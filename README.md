## Design

### Color palette

![Barmix website colour palette](/assets/images/colors-palette.jpg)  
I was primarily inspired by the vibrant blue color of the cocktail in the hero image when choosing the color palette for the website.  
The chosen color palette combines soft tones of white, light gray, and shades of blue, creating a sense of elegance and professionalism for the website. Additionally, the use of soft colors in contrast with darker ones helped create a pleasant visual experience and facilitated reading and navigation on the website.

### Typography 

Google Fonts was utilized to incorporate the selected font styles into the website. 

The font "Lora" was chosen for most of the text used on the website, a versatile and legible serif font, ideal for long texts. On the other hand, the font "Cinzel Decorative" was used for headings and highlights as it is a more ornate and impactful display font.

The selected images for the website aim to showcase the professional and engaging work of bartenders at events and workshops. The chosen photographs portray cocktails being crafted, skilled mixologists in action, and images that align with the services offered on the site, all with the purpose of inspiring confidence in potential clients.

### Features

The website consists of four pages: a welcoming home page, a detailed services page, a gallery, and a contact us page. 

#### Navigation bar 

* All pages have a responsive navigation bar at the top.  
* At the top left, there is the "BarMix" logo, which, when clicked, takes the user back to the home page.  
* On the top right, there is the menu with links to the pages of the site - Home, Services, Gallery, and Contact Us.  
* To ensure that the menu items are aligned on smaller screens such as tablets and smartphones, adjustments were made in media queries to center them below the logo.  
* To facilitate the user's understanding of their location on the website, a border effect was added when the mouse cursor hovers over the menu items and when the page is open, the name of the page remains in bold.

#### Home Page 

##### Header: 

* The chosen hero image showcases a skillful bartender crafting a cocktail. The selected photo boasts excellent resolution and vibrant colors, which helps grab visitors' attention right from the start.
