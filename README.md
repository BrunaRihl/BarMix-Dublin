### Color palette

The chosen color palette combines soft tones of white, light gray, and shades of blue, creating a sense of elegance and professionalism for the website. These color choices were made to convey an atmosphere of seriousness and trust, which are important aspects for the service offered. Additionally, the use of soft colors in contrast with darker ones helped create a pleasant visual experience and facilitated reading and navigation on the site.
